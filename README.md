# accents

This web application allows students to compare their pronunciation of sentences with provided baseline recordings, to both improve their accent and help them understand the intricacies of the languages they learn. The application processes student voice recordings and analyzes [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)), [formants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant), and [intensity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_intensity) variations, and displays them in clear graphs that can be played with.
